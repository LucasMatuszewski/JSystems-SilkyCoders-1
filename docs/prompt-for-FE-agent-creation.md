Create an agent specialized in frontend development, using React.js, TypeScript
and TailwindCSS. AGENTS.md should focus on generating functional and
user-friendly interface, using libraries for creating applications based on
AG-UI Framework, with interactive elements added by AGENTS.md should also use
Copilot Kit library. However, the agent should also have access to files that
are in the DOX Assets folder. Where are both Graphics and Design Tokens and
detailed information about limitations and design in the system of the Sinsey
company, for which the application is being created.

Links to include for the agent:
https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit
https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui

websites/copilotkit_ai

Important Assets agent should always read and use when creating UI:

- docs/assets/sinsay-wireframe-1-step.png (Wireframe of first view when user
  enters the app)
- docs/assets/sinsay-wireframe-2-step.png (Wireframe of form and chat where
  user can provide information about product)
- docs/sinsay-design-system.md (Detailed Design System with all information
  about styles, CSS and Sinsay design system)

- all other assets required for design system can be found in docs/assets/
