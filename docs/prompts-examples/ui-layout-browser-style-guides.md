My FE app is running on http://127.0.0.1:5173/  port - open it in your build in browser to see how it looks.

Describe what you see, test base functionality and analyse the @docs/PRD-Sinsay-PoC.md to make a plan of changes we should implement to make it look better and aligned with PRD.

you should also take a look on https://www.sinsay.com/pl  website using your build in browser and analyse how it looks like. This is our ecommerce main landing page and our PoC should be aligned with this page.

Analyse all the styles and colors, fonts, margins, paddings, rounded corners and all other important UI and UX elements and first provide detailed description with styleguides our PoC should follow to look in the same style. You may also check URLs of logo and implement it on PoC with same URL from the web.

Search also for forms on our landing page and check how it works, the borders, hover, animations. We should reimplement it.

If your internal browser  @Browser will not be enough to get all the data you can also use chrome-devtools MCP tool you have. Compare if it can get more accurate data for you vs our browser.

First list all the data and all the details before you will implement the new layout based on Sinsay landing page
